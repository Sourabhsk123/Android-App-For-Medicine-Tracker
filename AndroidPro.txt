Android manifest
The manifest file describes essential information about your app such as Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play, permissions, 
and other activities.

Android SDK
The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) is a crucial part of Android development, It consists of tools like emulator etc and also libraries for code for making 
Java programs work with the Android platform.


What is Gradle in Android
3rd party dependencies, main configuration of the app and other configurations of the app are stored.
a gradle takes all the source files (java and XML) and converts and compress all of them into one single file known as apk(Android Application Package)
There are two types of build.gradle scripts
Top-level build.gradle ------------ define the build configurations that will be applied to all the modules in the project. contain buildscripts and allprojects
Module-level build.gradle --------- all the dependencies are defined and where the sdk versions are declared. contains android build types, sdk version etc.


Activity
An Android activity is one screen of the Android app's user interface. Activity is the part where the user will interacts with your application


Fragment
Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity.


Intents
Intents often describe the action which should be performed and provide data upon which such an action should be done.
Intent are used for communicating between the Application components and it also provides the connectivity between two apps.
For example: Intent facilitate you to redirect your activity to another activity on occurrence of any event. By calling, startActivity() you can perform this task.


Shared Preferences 
Shared Preferences is the way in which one can store and retrieve small amounts of primitive data as key/value pairs to a file on the device storage 
such as String, int, float, Boolean that make up your preferences in an XML file inside the app on the device storage.


Views
View is the base class for widgets, which are used to create interactive UI components like buttons, text fields, etc


Oncreate
onCreate(Bundle) is where you initialize your activity. When Activity is started and application is not loaded, then both onCreate() methods will be called. 
But for subsequent starts of Activity , the onCreate() of application will not be called.
onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup, int)This method is called right when the adapter is created and is used to initialize your ViewHolder(s).
Called by RecyclerView to display the data at the specified position. abstract VH. onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) 
Called when RecyclerView needs a new RecyclerView. ViewHolder of the given type to represent an item.

OnclickListener
In Android, the OnClickListener() interface has an onClick(View v) method that is called when the view (component) is clicked. 

Adaptor
In Android, Adapter is a bridge between UI component and data source that helps us to fill data in UI component. It holds the data and send the data to an 
Adapter view then view can takes the data from the adapter view and shows the data on different views like as ListView, GridView, Spinner etc.


RecyclerView
The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView.
In the RecyclerView model, several different components work together to display your data.
The overall container for your user interface is a RecyclerView object that you add to your layout


getitemCount
getItemCount returns the total number of items in your RecyclerView and getViewType is called with values



Onbind
onBindViewHolder(VH holder, int position) Called by RecyclerView to display the data at the specified position. void. 
onBindViewHolder(VH holder, int position, List<Object> payloads) Called by RecyclerView to display the data at the specified position.


model class
You can model your data in Android using standard Java design patterns. The class is designed to store data in private fields, members of the class, 
and to make that data accessible to the rest of the application through setter and getter methods.


utilityclass
Utility class is used because it does not belong to any other thing in the android.Utility Class, also known as Helper class, is a class, 
which contains just static methods, it is stateless and cannot be instantiated. It contains a bunch of related methods, so they can be reused across the application. 
As an example consider firebaseotp authentication and prefManager, it does not belong to any other objects than itself in android.


Preferences
Preferences in Android are used to keep track of application and user preferences. In any application, there are default preferences that can accessed 
through the PreferenceManager instance and its related method getDefaultSharedPreferences(Context). Preferences are stored as groups of key/value pairs 
and are available  at the Activity level or shared across all of Activity classes for a given application (but not outside of the application package).



What is broadcast receiver in android?
A broadcast receiver (receiver) is an Android component which allows you to register for system or application events. 
All registered receivers for an event are notified by the Android runtime once this event happens.Android BroadcastReceiver is a 
dormant component of android that listens to system-wide broadcast events or intents. 
When any of these events occur it brings the application into action by either creating a status bar notification or performing a task


OnMapRreadyCallback: This callback interface invokes when it instance is set on MapFragment object. The onMapReady(GoogleMap) method of OnMapReadyCallback 
interface is called when the map is ready to used. 
In the onMapReady(GoogleMap) method we can add markers, listeners and other attributes.


LocationListener: This interface is used to receive notification when the device location has changed. 
The abstract method of LocationListener onLocationChanged(Location) is called when the location has changed.


GoogleApiClient.ConnectionCallbacks: This interface provide callbacks methods onConnected(Bundle) and onConnectionSuspended(int) 
which are called when the device is to connected and disconnected.


GoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListener: This interface provide callbacks method onConnectionFailed(ConnectionResult) 
which is called when there was an error in connecting the device to the service.

What does onReceive () mean?
Whenever the event for which the receiver is registered occurs, onReceive() is called. 
For instance, in case of battery low notification, the receiver is registered to Intent.

Viewpager Adoptor
Layout manager that allows the user to flip left and right through pages of data. 
You supply an implementation of a PagerAdapter to generate the pages that the view shows.


extends
The extends keyword extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class). 
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.
